# Subspace Legacy

> ⚠️ **Archive Notice**: This codebase is now archived. The active development has moved to [@subspace-dev](https://github.com/subspace-dev).
 


Subspace is an intergalactic communication app built on the Permaweb. It allows you to chat in online communities without the fear of censorship.

> The legacy version is still available at [https://legacy_subspace.ar.io](https://legacy_subspace.ar.io) but might have bugs and could break


> If you are using the legacy app and cant seem to send any messages, it is because of how permissions are managed. Ask the server owner to assign you a role on the server. The role must have send messages permission
